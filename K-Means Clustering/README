This program which uses Spark to cluster given Twitter tweets by their geographic origins (coordinates), using
the K-means clustering algorithm.

The file twitter contains the tweets and their attributes. The first two values in each line are
the world coordinates from which the respective tweet was posted. The other values are a time stamp, a user id, an
optional flag 1=spam/0=no spam, and finally the actual tweet message.

This program learns a K-means clustering with four clusters from this file. From each line in the file, only the
coordinates are used as features for learning.

Finally, the program prints every tweet (message) in the given file together with its respective cluster index (that
is, the number of the cluster which contains that tweetâ€™s coordinates, according to the learned model), sorted by the
cluster indices.
