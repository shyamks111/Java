Data set imdb_labelled.txt in this archive contains a number of single-sentence movie reviews, each labeled with “0”
(negative sentiment) or “1” (positive sentiment).

This program builds a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using any 60% of the labeled sentences
in imdb_labelled.txt as training data, using Spark MLlib and RDDs 
Afterwards, it use the learned model to predict and print the labels (sentiments) of the test movie reviews 


Finally, it estimates the accuracy of a classifier by computing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC)
